[GOC:di, GOC:mah, GOC:mcc, PMID:16339736]
comment: Note that ascospores and asci are separate biological structures. The ascus is the structure that contain the ascospores, but the development of the ascus is a different process than the formation of the ascospores themselves; for instance, some mutations affect sporulation without affecting ascus development. For this reason, GO:0030437 ascospore formation and GO:0075317 ascus development are different terms and are not linked.

For transport through the nuclear pore, consider instead the term 'nucleocytoplasmic transport ; GO:0006913' and its children. Note also that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.
